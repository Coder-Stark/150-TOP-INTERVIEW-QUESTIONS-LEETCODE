# 150-TOP-INTERVIEW-QUESTIONS-LEETCODE

This repository documents my journey in tackling the 150 Top Interview Questions provided by LeetCode. The collection consists of fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems frequently encountered in technical interviews.

## Motivation

The primary goal of this repository is to showcase my progress and solutions to these essential coding challenges. The problems range from array manipulations to dynamic programming, covering a diverse set of concepts crucial for mastering algorithmic problem-solving.

## Structure

- Each problem is organized into its own directory, named descriptively to indicate the problem's nature.
- Inside each directory, you will find:
  - **BruteForce**: Initial, straightforward solution to the problem.
  - **Optimized**: A more efficient and optimized solution with detailed explanations.
  - **Complexity Analysis**: Time and space complexity analysis for both solutions.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the solutions based on your needs:

1. Review the problem statement in the respective directory.
2. Examine the BruteForce and Optimized solutions for a comprehensive understanding.
3. Dive into the complexity analysis to grasp the efficiency of each approach.

## Contribution

If you find improvements, alternative solutions, or have any suggestions, I welcome contributions! Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Disclaimer

These solutions are my interpretations, and there might be multiple ways to approach each problem. The provided solutions aim to be clear, concise, and optimized for better understanding.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to LeetCode for providing this curated list of interview questions, helping me enhance my problem-solving skills.

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
